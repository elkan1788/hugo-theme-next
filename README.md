# NexT For Hugo

A Hugo theme port from [NexT](https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next).

[Online Documents](https://next-docs.lisenhui.cn)

## Discription

NexT is a simple and animated theme. I port it from Hexo to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and used in my blog site.

Thanks for [xtfly](https://github.com/xtfly), I had cloned his NetxT theme and modify by my own custom style. 

## Preview: 

1. Online Visit

[https://lisenhui.cn](https://lisenhui.cn)

2. Local Visit

First use your console then into exampleSite directory, Second start site running to use `hugo server --noHTTPCache --t ../..` command, Last look style with open browser: http://localhost:1313/

>Note: Maybe there plugins couldn't running without the paramters change the value.

## Usage

1. download theme file: `git clone git@github.com:elkan1788/hugo-theme-next.git next`

2. copy `next` directory to `themes` directory in your hugo site

3. move `exampleSite\config` to the root directory in your hugo site, and modify it to the actual information for your site.

4. create some markdown files in directory(content/post), refere the struct and content in directory(exampleSite\content)
> Maybe you can copy the `exampleSite\content` to your site

5. start hugo server in root directory: `hugo server --noHTTPCache`

6. open brower: http://localhost:1313/

## Notes

- **Some of the Hexo's styles are not work now** because of the difference between the Hugo template engine and the Hexo. I will update it constantly

- This theme has been tested only in my blog site. Maybe it's not suitable for your requirements, you can customizate it by your preferences.

- Test in Hugo verion: 0.74.2+

- If you have any questions, please give feedback or open issues

## Markdown notes

1. every markdown start with like this:

    ```
    ---
    title: "Hello World"
    slug: hexo-hello-world
    date: "2020-09-11"
    tags: 
      - 测试
      - 学习
    categories:
